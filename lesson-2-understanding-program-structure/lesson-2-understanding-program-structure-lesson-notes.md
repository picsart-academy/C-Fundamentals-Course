# Lesson 2. Understanding Program Structure

A **digraph** in C is a two-character sequence, which means something more than either of the characters alone. For example, \n digraph, which represents the <newline> character to be output to the console.

Digraphs that appear in strings are also called **escape sequences** (they escape from the normal meaning of every single character).
